# UI Card for versatile Thermostat

> ![Tip](https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile_thermostat/blob/main/images/tips.png?raw=true) This card is dedicated to the Versatile Thermostat integration which is available in HACS also and [here](https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile_thermostat).
> 
> This card is based on the beautiful (Better Thermostat UI Card)[https://github.com/KartoffelToby/better-thermostat-ui-card]. It adds some feature so that you can use Versatile Thermostat directly from the card. A big thanks to @KartoffelToby for this Better Thermostat UI Card.

## Goals

- [X] Add versatile_thermostat support for showing the extra status
- [X] Improve the UI for Touch devices

# Installation

For installation you should have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download/) installed. Then add this repository https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile-thermostat-ui-card in HACS and install the card. You have to reload you browser after installation.

Then you can add the new card into your dashboard.

# Actions
Some actions are available directly on the card.

__Note:__ all actions done on the card and resetted if the VTherm integration restarts. If you want persistant change, you must edit the configuration of the VTherm itself on the Versatile Thermostat integration.

## Change the preset temperature
Preset temperature cann be changed directly from the card with the following actions:
1. select the preset, you want to change,
2. select the temperature you want to set with the selector or the +/- buttons,
3. double click on the preset you want to change. When this action occurs, the preset rapidly change to the previous value and then to the new value to indicate that it is stored.

You can do this operations for all displayed presets but not on the `Activity` preset because this preset uses the temperature values of the others preset. See documentation of [versatile_thermostat README](https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile_thermostat/blob/main/README.md#configure-the-activity-mode-or-motion-detection).

Of course you should have displayed the presets to be able to do so.

## Disable the auto-fan mode
For `over_climate` you have the possibility to configure the `auto-fan` mode feature. See [versatile_thermostat README](https://github.com/jmcollin78/versatile_thermostat/blob/main/README.md#auto-fan-mode).

If the `auto-fan` mode is configured, you can toggle between the configured `auto_fan_mode` configured for the VTherm and the None mode (which disable the auto-fan mode).

To toggle the auto-fan mode you must:
1. click on the `Auto-fan` icon at the left of the Thermostat.
